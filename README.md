Data Science X Logistic Regression

### ToDo

- [x] Describe
    - [x] get list of cleaned numerical dataset
    - [x] func(dataset: Series[float]) -> dic(min: float, max: float, ...)

- [x] Data Visualization
    - [x] Histogram
    - [x] Scatter Plot (each pair of feature/course transfiguration/flying...)
    - [x] Pair Plot (matrice of scatter plots with histograms on matrice diagonal)

- [ ] Logistic Regression [Formule markdown](/formula.md)
    - [ ] train
        - [ ] SGD
    - [ ] predict
    - [ ] test accuracy

- [ ] NaN Values to deal with
- [ ] Data handling // preprossessing >> move cleaned and things like that in data

### Questions

what about the absence of data ?
during training and during prediction
